# Checkpoint 1 Work

Both of us performed bug fixes while debugging code generally wherever applicable.



Tej Jaideep Patel:

Realloc, efficient version of code right now commented out By ME, to make do for the checkpoint skyler fixed it using malloc calls to make it 50/50 for now. May come back to commented version to keep efficiency if no other way to fix

Heap Checker, By ME. Not tested right now as not needed for checkpoint version. 




Skyler Hawkins:
Contributions: 
    Initial setup of structs
    mm_init implementation
    malloc 
    free
    realloc fix for now
Comments from Skyler: Worked closely with Tej for debugging, both of us have an understanding of the entire project.

# Final Submission Work

Skyler and Tej worked together closely through the majority of the final. We split our time into two similar implementations, but are familiar with and helped each other with both.  In the end, we designed a manual memory allocator that implements block splitting, coalescing, and the footer optimization. We were unable to maximize our memory utilization, however we gained a deep understanding of memory allocators.

Our submission ran a 77/100 on the lab machines, so it is expected to do the same during testing.
